The city is unveiling the new greenhouse. The mayor is putting on a ribbon
cutting ceremony.

Come show up to see the unveiling of new species to the region:
* Atriplex coulteri (It's a saltbush!)
* Delphinium parryi ssp. parryi (It's nice and purple.)
* Eucalyptus spp. (Good to clear your sinus problems.)
* Lotus hamatus (Not your average lotus.)
* Torilis arvensis (from the parsley family.)

These plants are guaranteed to be beautiful. Show up first to guarantee
